                    { code: 'import java.util.Scanner;', explanation: 'This line imports the Scanner class from the java.util package, which is essential for reading user input from the console. Without this import, the program cannot use Scanner to capture data. In Java, imports are necessary to access classes outside the current package. This sets up the foundation for interactive programs. It allows the program to handle various input types like integers and strings.' },
                    { code: 'public class PositiveCheck {', explanation: 'This defines the public class named PositiveCheck, which is the container for the main method. In Java, every application must have at least one public class. The class name should match the file name if it is public. This structure organizes the code logically. It ensures the program can be compiled and run properly.' },
                    { code: '    public static void main(String[] args) {', explanation: 'This is the entry point of the Java program where execution begins. The main method is static, allowing it to be called without creating an instance. It takes an array of strings as arguments for command-line inputs. This method is required in every executable Java class. It handles the core logic of the application.' },
                    { code: '        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);', explanation: 'Here, a Scanner object is created to read from standard input (console). System.in represents the keyboard input stream. This object will be used to get user data. Scanners can parse primitive types and strings efficiently. Closing the scanner is good practice to free resources.' },
                    { code: '        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");', explanation: 'This prints a prompt message to the console without a newline. It guides the user on what input is expected. System.out is the standard output stream. Using print instead of println keeps the cursor on the same line for input. This improves user experience in interactive programs.' },
                    { code: '        int num = sc.nextInt();', explanation: 'This reads an integer from the user input using the Scanner\'s nextInt method. It stores the value in the variable num. If non-integer input is provided, it may throw an exception. This line captures the data for processing. Input validation can be added for robustness.' },
                    { code: '        if (num > 0) {', explanation: 'This if statement checks if the number is greater than zero. It is a decision-making construct that executes the block only if true. This demonstrates basic conditional logic in Java. The condition uses a relational operator. Braces define the scope of the if block.' },
                    { code: '            System.out.println("Number is positive.");', explanation: 'If the condition is true, this prints that the number is positive followed by a newline. It provides feedback to the user. println adds a line break automatically. This output is conditional based on input. It completes the positive check logic.' },
                    { code: '        }', explanation: 'This closes the if block, ending the conditional execution. Any code after this will run regardless of the condition. Proper indentation helps readability. This brace matches the opening one. It structures the control flow properly.' },
                    { code: '        sc.close();', explanation: 'This closes the Scanner object to release system resources. It is good practice to close scanners after use. Failing to close can lead to resource leaks. This ensures efficient memory management. It is typically placed at the end of main.' },
                    { code: '    }', explanation: 'This closes the main method block. All code within main must be inside these braces. It defines the end of the program\'s entry point. Proper closure is necessary for compilation. This completes the method definition.' },
                    { code: '}', explanation: 'This closes the class definition. Every opening brace needs a matching closing one. It encapsulates all methods and fields. This marks the end of the Java class. The program is now complete and ready to compile.' }

                    { code: 'public class EvenOdd {', explanation: 'Defines the public class EvenOdd for the program. Classes in Java organize code into reusable units. Public access allows it to be run as an application. The name should be descriptive. This is the top-level structure.' },
                    { code: '    public static void main(String[] args) {', explanation: 'Main method serves as the program starting point. Static means no object instantiation needed. Args handle command-line parameters. Required for standalone Java apps. Contains the primary logic.' },

                    { code: '        } else {', explanation: 'Else clause for false condition. Executes when if is false. Handles the alternative case. No condition needed for else. Balances the decision structure.' },
                    { code: '            System.out.println("Odd");', explanation: 'Prints "Odd" for odd numbers. Alternative output. Uses println for line break. This is the false case. Ensures complete coverage of cases.' },
                    { code: '        }', explanation: 'Closes the if-else block. Ends conditional logic. Code after runs always. Maintains flow control. Matches opening braces.' },
